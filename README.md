# Udacity Disaster Response Analysis

Libraries Used:
  - Pandas
  - NLTK
  - re
  - Sklearn

I am completing this project as part of my requirement in the Data Scientist Nanodegree course at Udacity

Files used:
   - messages.csv - 
   - categories.csv 

I was given the opportunity to analyze messages sent during disasters. This project involves building a ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load the data. Additionally, I got to develop a machine learning pipeline to classify those messages to make them more useful to relief agencies.

Thank you to the Udacity team for providing the data and giving me exposure to the data science world. Acknowledgements also to RSM for giving me the opportunity to delve into this curiousity and diversify my skillsets.
